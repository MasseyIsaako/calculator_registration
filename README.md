# Calculator and Registration Project
Created by Massey Isa'ako

This project is a learning experience for me, in terms of learning more about PHP and MYSQL.

This calculator/registration form is a medium through which I hope to learn more about 
form validation via php and running MYSQL queries through to a DB.

I am also using this as an opportunityto familiarise myself with the PSR-2 standards as well
as gaining basic generic knowledge about PHP. E.g. types of classes, function/methods, interfaces etc.
