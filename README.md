# Calculator and Registration Project

This is a personal learning project mostly in developing PHP and MYSQL skills.

This calculator/registration features form validation via php and runs MYSQL queries through to the Database.

Development of familiarity with PSR-2 standards as well as gaining basic knowledge about PHP. E.g. types of classes, function/methods etc.

I have been developing this project using Vagrant to host my local LAMP virtual environment.
